  Due to their structure and usage condition, water meters face degradation,
  breaking, freezing, and leakage problems. There are various studies intended
  to determine the appropriate time to replace degraded ones. Earlier studies
  have used several features, such as user meteorological parameters, usage
  conditions, water network pressure, and structure of meters to detect failed
  water meters. This article proposes a recommendation framework that uses
  registered water consumption values as input data and provides meter
  replacement recommendations. This framework takes time series of registered
  consumption values and preprocesses them in two rounds to extract effective
  features. Then, multiple un-/semi-supervised outlier detection methods are
  applied to the processed data and assigns outlier/normal labels to them. At
  the final stage, a hypergraph-based ensemble method receives the labels and
  combines them to discover the suitable label. Due to the unavailability of
  ground truth labeled data for meter replacement, we compare our method with
  respect to its FPR and two internal metrics: Dunn index and Davies-Bouldin
  Index. Results of our comparative experiments show that the proposed framework
  detects more compact clusters with smaller variance.
